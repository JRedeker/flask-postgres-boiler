# Flask - Postgres - Python 3 Boilerplate

This repository provides a sample Python web application implemented using the ``Flask`` web framework and hosted using ``gunicorn``.
It includes a sample connection to a ``postgresql`` database

🥤 This flask structure allows larger applications with multiple modules using Blueprints

🐍 ``Python 3.5.4`` was originally used for this 🐍

## Implementation Notes
- Install packages from ``requirements.txt`` 📦
- Rename modules 🤔
- Configure ``configure.py`` with database information 🐘
- Run ``app.py`` (make sure root) 🚀
